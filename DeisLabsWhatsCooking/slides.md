# Who am I?

- Senior Software Engineer in Microsoft Azure
- Helm Core Maintainer
- GitHub: [@thomastaylor312](https://github.com/thomastaylor312)

- I'm a software engineer at Azure primarily working on the DeisLabs team (I'll
  explain what team that is in just a second). I used to work on AKS as well
- So why listen to me?
- I am in a lucky position where I work on Open Source and Microsoft so happens
  to pay me
- I have been involved in this whole "Cloud Native" thing since almost the
  beginning and I enjoy helping people out. So what I talk about today will be
  focused on some of the open source projects my team is working on, but maybe
  they aren't the best technology choice for you. But I still hope you'll learn
  something from us and our experience. Feel free to ask me about any
  technologies and I will give you my best educated opinion about them

# What is this DeisLabs thing?

???
- Deis Labs is a shoutout to Deis, the organization where many of us started our
  journey into Kubernetes and Open Source. If you hadn't heard of Deis, it was a
  startup working on Kubernetes and containers tooling and was acquired by
  Microsoft
- Some of the people on this team created Phippy and some of the other
  characters described here.
- Our goal is to create great open source software and build healthy, diverse
  communities for those projects
- Most people, when they hear about Microsoft doing open source, are fairly
  skeptical. I've had plenty of people come up to me and quote the whole
  "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" thing. But what I love about our team is that
  our primary goal is running open communities. Most of our projects are
  technically owned by the CNCF and worked on by many other companies. Like I
  said before, I am going to talk about some of our projects and how they can
  help you, but I will give you honest opinions about our own projects and will
  talk about other technologies

Maybe per project "deep dives" here?
