# Advanced Interactions with Kubernetes
### As Taught by Helm
##### Taylor Thomas - Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft Azure

.footnote[Cloud Native Rejekts San Diego 2019]

---
# Who am I?

- Senior Software Engineer in Microsoft Azure
- Helm Core Maintainer
- GitHub: [@thomastaylor312](https://github.com/thomastaylor312)
- Twitter: [@_oftaylor](https://twitter.com/_oftaylor)
- Kubernetes Slack: @oftaylor

???

- I'm a software engineer at Azure primarily working on Helm, but also some
  other open source projects. I used to work on AKS as well
- So why listen to me?
- Been a core maintainer on Helm for 3 years
- Done waaaaay too much work interacting with Kubernetes (going back to version
  1.2)
- One more final note, these will be pretty advanced topics that assume you
  already know about different Kubernetes objects and some of the underlying
  details of how it deals with different situations (patching, API requests,
  etc.). So if you do not have that knowledge, you are more than welcome to
  stay, but it might get a bit confusing. And even though we are using Helm as a
  backdrop for all of this, no prior knowledge of Helm or its code is required

---

# Topics

- Handling multiple API versions
- Using object statuses
- 3 way patching
- Object building (including unstructured types and how to convert them)
- Validation
- Discovery client and cache
- A brief review of the more obtuse/little-known k8s packages

???

- We may not have time to go over all of the points here, but I will be breezing
  along fairly rapidly. There is a link to the slides at the end so you can look
  over them at your lesiure later
- I plan to stop briefly for questions at the end of each topic so you don't
  have to hold on to them as we go through the rest of the topics

---

# Multiple API Versions

- This is probably much more simple than you think it would be
--
count: false

- The answer? Use the most recent version of the API

???

- This applies to both built in k8s types and CRDs (k8s does conversion
  underneath the hood)

--
count: false
```go
switch value := AsVersioned(v).(type) {
case *appsv1.Deployment, *appsv1beta1.Deployment, *appsv1beta2.Deployment, *extensionsv1beta1.Deployment:
    currentDeployment, err := w.c.AppsV1().Deployments(v.Namespace).Get(v.Name, metav1.GetOptions{})
    if err != nil {
        return false, err
    }
...
}
```

???

- However, you can also do cool things like this with a raw `runtime.Object`

---
layout: true
# Using object statuses
#### Some examples from `--wait`

---

- Be warned: Statuses are a bit of a hairy mess
- Always check the [Kubernetes API Reference]() for specific definitions on all
  status fields

???

- They can be a bit messy, but that is why I have some examples for you, from
  Helm's wait logic
- There could be various things you want to do with status objects, so I am
  going to focus on what the fields in each status indicate and things to watch
  out for.
- I'll be starting easy, and then progressing to harder ones with each example

---

##### Deployments

```go
// If paused deployment will never be ready
if currentDeployment.Spec.Paused {
    continue
}
// Find RS associated with deployment
newReplicaSet, err := deploymentutil.GetNewReplicaSet(currentDeployment, w.c.AppsV1())
if err != nil || newReplicaSet == nil {
    return false, err
}
```

???

- This is the code that actually gets the most current replica set and checks
  for a few other things
- One of the important things to note is that often you have to check both the
  Spec and the Status to ascertain the true status of the object

---

##### Deployments

```go
func (w *waiter) deploymentReady(rs *appsv1.ReplicaSet, dep *appsv1.Deployment) bool {
    expectedReady := *dep.Spec.Replicas - deploymentutil.MaxUnavailable(*dep)
    if !(rs.Status.ReadyReplicas >= expectedReady) {
        w.log("Deployment is not ready: %s/%s. %d out of %d expected pods are ready", dep.Namespace, dep.Name, rs.Status.ReadyReplicas, expectedReady)
        return false
    }
    return true
}
```

- You can tell if a `Deployment` is ready by: number of `ReadyReplicas` in the
  new `ReplicaSet` == The number you want

???

- The code is the actual check and is fairly simple. I'll cover what is in
  deployment util later on
- In a classic case of "who wrote this code?! Oh, it's me," I can't remember why
  we don't use a combination of the `unavailableReplicas` and `readyReplicas`
  fields, but I think there is a reason about what is getting updated. Basically
  this may end up with me re-writing this code block

---

##### DaemonSets

```go
// Make sure all the updated pods have been scheduled
if ds.Status.UpdatedNumberScheduled != ds.Status.DesiredNumberScheduled {
    w.log("DaemonSet is not ready: %s/%s. %d out of %d expected pods have been scheduled", ds.Namespace, ds.Name, ds.Status.UpdatedNumberScheduled, ds.Status.DesiredNumberScheduled)
    return false
}
```

???

- This is a super interesting (and I feel helpful) tidbit. These two fields in
  the status help tell you if the updated spec is scheduled on all nodes.
  Because the number of scheduled nodes can differ, these two are all you need
  to reconstruct the current scheduling status of a DaemonSet (which sometimes
  takes a bit, given that many heavy admin processes in a cluster use a DS)

---

##### DaemonSets

```go
maxUnavailable, err := intstr.GetValueFromIntOrPercent(ds.Spec.UpdateStrategy.RollingUpdate.MaxUnavailable, int(ds.Status.DesiredNumberScheduled), true)
if err != nil {
    // If for some reason the value is invalid, set max unavailable to the
    // number of desired replicas. This is the same behavior as the
    // `MaxUnavailable` function in deploymentutil
    maxUnavailable = int(ds.Status.DesiredNumberScheduled)
}

expectedReady := int(ds.Status.DesiredNumberScheduled) - maxUnavailable
if !(int(ds.Status.NumberReady) >= expectedReady) {
    w.log("DaemonSet is not ready: %s/%s. %d out of %d expected pods are ready", ds.Namespace, ds.Name, ds.Status.NumberReady, expectedReady)
    return false
}

```
- You can tell if a `DaemonSet` is ready by: `UpdatedNumberScheduled` ==
  `DesiredNumberScheduled` && `NumberReady` == The number you want

???

- Here you'll see the use of some of the same fields we used before. Note again
  the need to reach into the spec if you want to introspect some more
- We also use an interesting k8s util called `intstr`, which I'll go more into
  later
- The other major field here is `NumberReady`, which shows the actual number of
  running pods. However, this number also includes pods with the old spec that
  are still running and ready
- Like I said before, the summary here is that you need to put a bunch of the
  information together from an object status to know programmatically the
  current state

---

##### StatefulSets

The intricacies of the `partition`

```go
var partition int
// 1 is the default for replicas if not set
var replicas = 1
// For some reason, even if the update strategy is a rolling update, the
// actual rollingUpdate field can be nil. If it is, we can safely assume
// there is no partition value
if sts.Spec.UpdateStrategy.RollingUpdate != nil && sts.Spec.UpdateStrategy.RollingUpdate.Partition != nil {
    partition = int(*sts.Spec.UpdateStrategy.RollingUpdate.Partition)
}
if sts.Spec.Replicas != nil {
    replicas = int(*sts.Spec.Replicas)
}
```

???

- Next up on the fun status things that can trip you up, let's talk about
  `StatefulSets` and partitioning. Partitioning is used for times when you want
  to roll out a canary to one or two nodes before updating the rest
- First thing to know about  is that SO MANY fields are optional, so know that
  the default expected replicas is 1 and the default partition is 0
- Also, note the comment I have on that gnarly `if` statement. You can have a
  null update strategy, even though all of the other objects always have one set

---

##### StatefulSets

```go
expectedReplicas := replicas - partition

// Make sure all the updated pods have been scheduled
if int(sts.Status.UpdatedReplicas) != expectedReplicas {
    w.log("StatefulSet is not ready: %s/%s. %d out of %d expected pods have been scheduled", sts.Namespace, sts.Name, sts.Status.UpdatedReplicas, expectedReplicas)
    return false
}

if int(sts.Status.ReadyReplicas) != replicas {
    w.log("StatefulSet is not ready: %s/%s. %d out of %d expected pods are ready", sts.Namespace, sts.Name, sts.Status.ReadyReplicas, replicas)
    return false
}
```

- You can tell if a `StatefulSet` is ready by: `UpdatedReplicas` == `replicas` -
  `partition` && `ReadyReplicas` == `replicas`

???

- Similar to `DaemonSets`, you need to first check if all of the pods are
  scheduled, because the `ReadyReplicas` number includes previous specs that are
  running
- However, even if you are partitioning, you should expect all of the old pods
  _and_ the new pods to be ready and equal to the number of desired replicas

# Using object statuses
#### Gotchas, caveats, provisos

- Always validate your assumptions

???

- In summary, there are a lot of gotchas and things to be aware of for using
  status object. Each object behaves differently and the numbers can each mean
  different things even if they are named the same. 
- Because of the extensible nature of the kubernetes API and the seemingly
  infinite knobs you can tweak, make sure you don't assume that a status is
  giving you the correct info (ask me how I know)

--
count: false
- Ingress status does not work how you think. To quote
  [specifically](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C09QYUH5W/p1572019798187300):

???

- One big heads up I recently learned is how the ingress status works

--
count: false
> no [the status] is not required. It would make it also complicated if you have
> one controller that creates the L4 LB and another controller that does the L7
> routing. In some controllers you can have L4 and L7 in one, such that you have
> the optional flag.

--
count: false
- Last but not least: Remember Kubernetes uses eventual consistency

???

- This means that the status does not always perfectly reflect reality. Although
  it does 98% of the time

---
layout: true
# 3-way patches

---

- `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/strategicpatch`
- `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/types`

???
- First thing to know about are these two packages. The strategic patch utility
  has some super handy functions for generating patch objects to send to the
  kubernetes API and the types package contains the constants for the various
  patch types. You'll see these referenced in the next slides

---

???

- We have a handy function called `createPatch` in Helm that helps us do this.
  So let's break down the steps to creating a 3-way patch

--
count: false

```go
func createPatch(target *resource.Info, current runtime.Object) ([]byte, types.PatchType, error) {
    oldData, err := json.Marshal(current)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, types.StrategicMergePatchType, errors.Wrap(err, "serializing current configuration")
    }
    newData, err := json.Marshal(target.Object)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, types.StrategicMergePatchType, errors.Wrap(err, "serializing target configuration")
    }
```

???
- This function is generic and works for any kubernetes type. I'll dig deeper
  into the resource package later on, but an `Info` is a pretty helpful wrapper
  around a standard `runtime.Object` that contains a REST client configuration
  used to update or fetch its data.
- `current` in this function is the object that was originally used to create or
  update its state in storage (such as a file on your machine)
- The first step is to marshal all the data you have out to JSON so it can be
  used to create a JSON patch

---

```go
helper := resource.NewHelper(target.Client, target.Mapping)
currentObj, err := helper.Get(target.Namespace, target.Name, target.Export)
if err != nil && !apierrors.IsNotFound(err) {
    return nil, types.StrategicMergePatchType, errors.Wrapf(err, "unable to get data for current object %s/%s", target.Namespace, target.Name)
}

currentData, err := json.Marshal(currentObj)
if err != nil {
    return nil, types.StrategicMergePatchType, errors.Wrap(err, "serializing live configuration")
}
```

???
- This next block is where we fetch the current state of the object. `NewHelper`
  is part of the resource package and just creates a new client. However, if you
  are just using the plain `Get` methods of the Kubernetes clientset, you'll
  need to strip off the status object and a few other fields because you can't
  specify the export options with `Get`
- When you are fetching the current data, generally it is ok if it is not found.
  Generally that means the object was unintentionally deleted or was never
  created
- Once you have the data, you also marshal that out to JSON

---
##### WARNING: Super Advanced

```go
// Get a versioned object
versionedObject := AsVersioned(target)

if _, ok := versionedObject.(runtime.Unstructured); ok {
    // fall back to generic JSON merge patch
    patch, err := jsonpatch.CreateMergePatch(oldData, newData)
    return patch, types.MergePatchType, err
}
```

???

- As noted, this is a super advanced use case that probably 90% of you will
  never need, but it is extremely useful for the 10% who do. So I put it in here
  for people to reference.
- `AsVersioned` does some magic to make sure we have a structured kubernetes
  object. I'll cover how build and version objects in the next section 
- Unstructured objects, such as CRDs, may not have an not registered error
  returned from ConvertToVersion. Anything that's unstructured should use the
  jsonpatch.CreateMergePatch which is just a simple two way merge. Strategic
  Merge Patch is not supported on objects like CRDs.

--
count: false

```go
versionedObject := target.Object.(*appsv1.Deployment)
```

???
- If you aren't using the advanced use case, you should just type assert your
  object as shown here. You will need a typed object for the next step

---

```go
patchMeta, err := strategicpatch.NewPatchMetaFromStruct(versionedObject)
if err != nil {
    return nil, types.StrategicMergePatchType, errors.Wrap(err, "unable to create patch metadata from object")
}

patch, err := strategicpatch.CreateThreeWayMergePatch(oldData, newData, currentData, patchMeta, true)
```

???
- The patch metadata generation is what requires a versioned object. This is
  because under the hood it is doing some reflection to figure out the kind
- The last step is actual patch generation where you pass your original/old
  data, the new desired state, and the current state of the object (in that
  order) and the generated patch metadata. The boolean parameter specifies if
  you want to overwrite keys that already exist

---

```go
if patch == nil || string(patch) == "{}"
```

```go
Patch("the name", types.StrategicMergePatchType, patch)
```

???
- Two final notes here. First off, one of the nice things about doing things
  with a patch is that you can do this check to see if there were no changes
- That last thing is the actual patch creation. All of the `Patch` methods on
  the clientset have the same signature as shown here

---
layout: true
# Validation

---

- The short way of getting a validator is to use a `Factory` from
  `k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/cmd/util`
- However, for our own enjoyment, let's take a look at how to use validation
  manually

???
- We'll look at how the factory generates 

---
#### Packages to know about
- `k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/util/openapi`
- `openapivalidation "k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/util/openapi/validation"`
- `k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/validation`

---

```go
func (f *factoryImpl) OpenAPISchema() (openapi.Resources, error) {
    discovery, err := f.clientGetter.ToDiscoveryClient()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Lazily initialize the OpenAPIGetter once
    f.openAPIGetter.once.Do(func() {
        // Create the caching OpenAPIGetter
        f.openAPIGetter.getter = openapi.NewOpenAPIGetter(discovery)
    })

    // Delegate to the OpenAPIGetter
    return f.openAPIGetter.getter.Get()
}
```

???

- First off, how to get the OpenAPI data
- Please note that this `once` thing looks complicated. If you wanted to do it
  yourself, you probably wouldn't need to worry about this
- Note the use of the discovery client here. You'll have to have one
  constructed. Everyone know what the discovery client does?

---

```go
func (f *factoryImpl) Validator(validate bool) (validation.Schema, error) {
    if !validate {
        return validation.NullSchema{}, nil
    }

    resources, err := f.OpenAPISchema()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return validation.ConjunctiveSchema{
        openapivalidation.NewSchemaValidation(resources),
        validation.NoDoubleKeySchema{},
    }, nil
}
```

???
- Basically, no validation is as easy as using the NullSchema
- The last step is "joining" the two schemas together
- The schemas you see here are all of the ones that are exposed, however there
  is a simple interface to implement if you have some advanced custom schema you
  wish to use

# Object Building

---
#### Unstructured vs. Structured

- "Structured" objects are exactly what you'd think they are: concrete
  Kubernetes object types
- Kubernetes approaches "generic" objects through the use of something called
  "unstructured" objects

---
#### Unstructured vs. Structured 

```go
type Unstructured interface {
    Object
    // NewEmptyInstance returns a new instance of the concrete type containing only kind/apiVersion and no other data.
    // This should be called instead of reflect.New() for unstructured types because the go type alone does not preserve kind/apiVersion info.
    NewEmptyInstance() Unstructured
    // UnstructuredContent returns a non-nil map with this object's contents. Values may be
    // []interface{}, map[string]interface{}, or any primitive type. Contents are typically serialized to
    // and from JSON. SetUnstructuredContent should be used to mutate the contents.
    UnstructuredContent() map[string]interface{}
    // SetUnstructuredContent updates the object content to match the provided map.
    SetUnstructuredContent(map[string]interface{})
    // IsList returns true if this type is a list or matches the list convention - has an array called "items".
    IsList() bool
    // EachListItem should pass a single item out of the list as an Object to the provided function. Any
    // error should terminate the iteration. If IsList() returns false, this method should return an error
    // instead of calling the provided function.
    EachListItem(func(Object) error) error
}
```

???
- Unstructured objects are technically a go interface that looks like this.
- It wraps a traditional Object and contains the raw data for an object
- This is useful for CRD instances or if you don't care about having the actual
  objects

---
#### Building Objects from Manifests

- `k8s.io/cli-runtime/pkg/resource`

```go
builder := resource.NewBuilder(getter)
infos, err := builder.ContinueOnError().
        NamespaceParam(namespace).
        DefaultNamespace().
        Flatten().
        Unstructured(). // Only if you want unstructured
        Schema(schema).
        Stream(reader, "").
        Do().Infos()
```

???
- This is the package that you'll use to build objects from a stream of incoming
  documents
- It is probably one of the more funky Go things you'll see
- You need to pass a getter that implements the RESTClientGetter interface,
  which we'll cover later on
- Let's step through each one of these functions

---

#### Conversion

```go
func AsVersioned(info *resource.Info) runtime.Object {
	return convertWithMapper(info.Object, info.Mapping)
}

func convertWithMapper(obj runtime.Object, mapping *meta.RESTMapping) runtime.Object {
	var gv = runtime.GroupVersioner(schema.GroupVersions(scheme.Scheme.PrioritizedVersionsAllGroups()))
	if mapping != nil {
		gv = mapping.GroupVersionKind.GroupVersion()
	}
	if obj, err := runtime.ObjectConvertor(scheme.Scheme).ConvertToVersion(obj, gv); err == nil {
		return obj
	}
	return obj
}
```

???
- In Helm, we have this `AsVersioned` method. It is specifically designed for
  the resource Infos you've been seeing, but it can easily be designed for more
  generic usage
- The GroupVersioner interface can be taken from any group version kind or you
  can use the default like we do here using `runtime.GroupVersioner`
- Please note the use of scheme and schema here, which leads to a caveat

---
#### Conversion: A caveat

```go
import(
    apiextv1beta1 "k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/v1beta1"
    "k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes/scheme"
)

func yourClientCreate() {
    if err := apiextv1beta1.AddToScheme(scheme.Scheme); err != nil {
        // This should never happen.
        panic(err)
    }
    ...
}
```

???

- When you are using scheme, you have to make sure types are registered. If you
  are handling CRDs, they are not part of the schema by default, so you'll
  definitely need to add things to the schema like so
- In Helm we are registering things when we create our client, though you can do
  it where you want too
- Registering to the scheme is global

---
layout: true
# Discovery Client and Cache

---
#### Under the hood details

- You can find the packages it uses in `k8s.io/client-go/discovery/cached`
- There are two options to cache data: disk and in-memory. Disk is the default
- If using disk, it will create a cache path for your specfic server like so:
  `computeDiscoverCacheDir(filepath.Join(homedir.HomeDir(), ".kube", "cache",
  "discovery"), config.Host)`

???
- The compute cache dir function uses the server host name and collapses any
  non-supported characters into a name that will likely not collide. So you can
  go look in your home dir and find these caches if you wanted to

--

```go
wg := &sync.WaitGroup{}
resultLock := &sync.Mutex{}
for _, apiGroup := range apiGroups.Groups {
    for _, version := range apiGroup.Versions {
        groupVersion := schema.GroupVersion{Group: apiGroup.Name, Version: version.Version}
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            defer utilruntime.HandleCrash()

            apiResourceList, err := d.ServerResourcesForGroupVersion(groupVersion.String())
```

???

- So under the hood, if you have an empty cache, it will make calls to every
  single API endpoint (starting with the top level `/apis` call, which lists all
  available APIs) to discover what APIs are available. This is used for
  validation and constructing clients. But note that it is a bit heavier on the
  server than you'd think

---
#### Cache invalidation

- Reasons to invalidate your cache:
  - New CRD installed (probably the most common)
  - API server upgrade
  - New API Extension or any other type of extension point that adds an API
    version
- How do you do it?

```go
discoveryClient, err := i.cfg.RESTClientGetter.ToDiscoveryClient()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
discoveryClient.Invalidate()
// Give time for the CRD to be recognized.
if err := i.cfg.KubeClient.Wait(totalItems, 60*time.Second); err != nil {
    return err
}
// Make sure to force a rebuild of the cache.
discoveryClient.ServerGroups()
```

???

- So why would you want to invalidate the cache? In Helm we do it explicitly
  after installing a CRD because otherwise Helm has an invalid list of API
  versions, which makes its job of validating difficult
- Luckily, it is extremely simple to do this if you have a cached discovery
  client available (which is generally the standard client available). If, as
  part of your code, you are adding the new CRD or API version, you should wait
  for the CRD to reach an `Established` state. 
- Then you should call something that will rebuild the cache for you (like
  `ServerGroup`). Why? Because if you use your clientset elsewhere by
  reconstructing it, the "invalidated" flag will be unset and it will use the
  old cache if it hasn't expired

## Little Known Kubernetes Packages

---
#### k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/controller/deployment/util

- This is one of many useful util packages in the controllers package
- Other helpful functions include:
  - `DeploymentComplete`: Returns true if _all_ of the new pods are running
  - `ListPods`: lists all the pods the deployment targets
  - `Max*`: Functions that get the computed values for things like surge, max
    unavailable, etc.
- One big con to keep in mind: You'll be pulling in mainline k8s as a dependency

???

- Most of the other controllers like `DaemonSets` and `PersistentVolumes` have
  util packages
- You saw how we used it to get `MaxUnavailable` and the latest replica set, but
  here are some of the other helpful functions there

---
#### sigs.k8s.io/yaml

- A fork of `github.com/ghodss/yaml` optimized for kubernetes marshalling and
  unmarshalling
- It can also convert YAML to JSON and JSON to YAML

---

#### k8s.io/cli-runtime/pkg/resource

- Contains several helpful methods and objects for handling RESTful calls to get
  Kubernetes (or even Kubernetes-like) objects:
  - `Info`: A Kubernetes object wrapper that contains all the information to
    make API calls for the object
  - `Visitor`: A way to iterate over a generic list of Kubernetes objects
  - `Helper`: Generic client for fetching resources using REST calls

???

- If you are looking for flexibility in how you handle your kubernetes objects.
  This is the package you are looking for
- `Info` is extremely useful as it can handle typed or untyped objects

---
#### k8s.io/cli-runtime/pkg/genericclioptions

- An alternate way to get a clientset
- `ConfigFlags` is your friend. 
  - You can use `NewConfigFlags(true)` to get the `RESTClientGetter`
  - `getter.ToRESTConfig()` then gives you the config needed to set up a
    clientset

???
- You saw this package pop up multiple times in previous examples, but
  essentially it is an alternate way to get a clientset, although with some
  other helpful options
- There are plenty of other things in this package you can take a look at, but
  one of the most useful in my opinion is the `ConfigFlags` type.
- The nice thing about using this package over the `clientcmd` package in
  client-go is that you have much more flexibility and options. Easy access to
  REST meta mappings and it can be used directly with the `resource` package we
  just looked at

---

#### k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/intstr

- `GetValueFromIntOrPercent`: A nice shorthand to parse out a computed int value
- Or, you can use `Parse` on a string value to get the `IntOrString` type that
  has even more methods

???
- I'll end with the most simple, but still useful package
- This is a handy little utility for converting all of those fields that can be
  an int value or a string in YAML
