# Slides of Taylor
This is a repo containing as many of my slide decks as I wrote in
[RemarkJS](https://github.com/gnab/remark). I've put these on here so people
have access to both the slides and the notes. Each talk is available at
https://slides.oftaylor.com/[NameOfSubDirectory].

## Using these slides
Feel free to use any or all of these slides (or even contribute), but please
give credit if at all possible!
